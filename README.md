# allocation
allocates a set of employees, duties on different days in a month 
Input:
Line 1: number of duty per day 
Line 2: month year
Next 30 lines: number of duties each employee should have (hardcoded to 30 employees, employee count not an input param)
Output:
A csv file with name 'allocation_month_year.csv'

Note: Program automatically writes to the output file. Input can be given as file or from keyboard. Sample input file checked in the repo.

Note: It can be thought of as a problem to create a random 2D bool rectangular matrix  with constraint on row sum and column sum
